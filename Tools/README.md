## Tools that will OR may be used in our project ##
1. [Faceswap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos based on the original u/deepfakes code.

2. [Faceswap2](https://github.com/joshua-wu/deepfakes_faceswap) another repo based on the original u/deepfakes code.

3. [Faceit](https://github.com/goberoi/faceit) a wrapper around Faceswap.

4. [DeepFaceLab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab) Another version of Faceswap

5. [DeepfakeCapsuleGAN](https://github.com/snknitin/DeepfakeCapsuleGAN) Using Generative Adversarial Capsule Network (GAN) for deepfake generation

6. [Large resolution facemasked](https://github.com/dfaker/df) , weirdly warped, deepfake.

7. [Disrupting Deepfakes](https://github.com/natanielruiz/disrupting-deepfakes): Defending against image translation deepfakes using adversarial attacks.
